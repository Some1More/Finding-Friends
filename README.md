Developing a prototype app for finding friends, useful contacts and business partners

Development of an application where anyone can fill in a questionnaire about their interests, occupation and skills, and an algorithm will select potential people with similar interests for them. 
Once a week the app will select a group of several people with similar interests and activities. If people like each other's profiles and agree to meet, the service will help set up a time to meet. The app will also be able to make recommendations on how to start a dialogue and give advice on how to get out of awkward situations. The interviewees can then choose the format of the meeting: face-to-face/online. After the meeting, they can leave feedback for each other.
